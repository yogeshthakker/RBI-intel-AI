"""Clause-level chunking of RBI directive text.

This is a port of the chunker validated in the earlier Python pipeline
(02_chunk_clauses.py + 02b_clean_chunks.py), operating on document bodies
already in the shared database instead of on local PDFs.

Three things it has to get right, all learned the hard way on real documents:

  1. CHAPTER and ANNEX must produce distinct tags. When they shared one
     pattern, every Annex after the last chapter silently inherited that
     chapter's tag and produced duplicate labels.

  2. Table rows and worked examples ("AAA to AA All 0.00") open with a
     number and a period — structurally identical to a real clause. They
     are separated by classifying the *content*, not the shape: a real
     clause has enough words, a high enough alphabetic ratio, and at least
     one directive keyword. Fragments are merged into the preceding
     confirmed clause rather than dropped, so no text is lost.

  3. Modern RBI 2025 Master Directions (UCB series and others) use
     parenthesized clause numbering — (1), (2), (3) — instead of the bare
     "38." style used in older directions. The inline-break normaliser and
     clause-boundary patterns must handle both forms. PART I / PART II
     structural markers are also common in newer directions and must be
     tracked the same way as CHAPTER headings.

# A real chapter heading is always "CHAPTER <numeral>[ <sub-letter>] <dash>
# <Title Case name>" — e.g. "Chapter VIII – Responsible Lending Conduct".
# Without requiring that dash, this pattern also fires on an inline
# cross-reference split across a paragraph break, e.g.:
#   "...as referred in Sections C and F of\n\nChapter VIII, shall have the
#   same meaning as defined in..."
# That's prose citing another chapter by number, not a heading — but the old
# pattern matched it anyway, silently resetting current_chapter/section AND
# dropping the matched line's text entirely (chapter markers produce no
# chunk and are not appended to the current clause). Confirmed on two real
# Master Directions (rbi:md:13140, rbi:md:13156): both showed a stray
# chapter number briefly interrupting the real chapter sequence
# ("...CHI...CHVIII...CHII...", "...CHI...CHIV...CHII...") at exactly these
# inline-citation points. Requiring the dash separator fixes every observed
# case while still matching every real heading (verified against both
# documents' full heading lists).
